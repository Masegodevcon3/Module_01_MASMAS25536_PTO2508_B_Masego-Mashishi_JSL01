# 🗂️ Launch Career — Kanban Board

This project is a clean, responsive Kanban board built to mirror a provided Figma design as closely as possible — visually, structurally, and responsively.

It was created as part of a front-end learning module, with a strong focus on **layout accuracy, clean HTML/CSS, and real-world project structure**.
